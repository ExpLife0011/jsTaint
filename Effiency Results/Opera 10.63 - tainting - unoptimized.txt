Dynamic Taint Library Performance Tests
toLowerCase - untainted String test

Time in milliseconds for String.toLowerCase to run 100,000 times with the initial string untainted. The String is predefined. I repeated this test 10 times and found the average and the standard deviation. Lower time means better Performance.
Sum: 3518
Average: 351.8
St-DEV: 5.329165037789691

concat - tainted String test

In this test, I compared how long it took String.concat to run for each implementation. I chose the String.concat function because that is heavily used in many websites. I started with a string initialized with a value of a single random digit. I ran the function String.concat 100,000 times with a single random digit generated on the spot. I repeated this test 10 times and found the average and the standard deviation. Lower time means better Performance. (Time in Milliseconds)

Average: 453.7

Google V8 Benchmarks

This page contains a suite of pure JavaScript benchmarks that we have used to tune V8. The final score is computed as the geometric mean of the individual results to make it independent of the running times of the individual benchmarks and of a reference system (score 100). Higher scores means better performance: Bigger is better!
